# Script to implement Icard, Kominsky and Knobe 2017

# ------------- DEFINITIONS --------------------------------
# **Necessity**: if C didn't occur, E didn't occur
# **Sufficiency**: if C occurred, E occurred


# Decisions
# "They propose that, when evaluating causality, people sample a counterfactual world 
# ... with probability proportional to how likely that world is." 
# Does that mean our Exp1's situation model? Yes, it means how likely each action is, given the factors.
# BUT DOES THAT MEAN THE SAME THING?

# For example, world where chose longHotdog.
# To evaluate whether Preference=1 is the cause of choosing longHotdog, they sample a world in which
# Preference=0 in proportion to how often Preference=0

# If assume so, load 64 combinations of factors defined in 'worldsetup.R', weighted by beta slope parameters 
# obtained from behavioural experiment and saved as pChoice df via worlds.rdata


# "Then, crucially, people evaluate a different counterfactual depending on what they sampled. 
# If they sampled a world in which focal = 0, they evaluate whether focal was necessary 
# (holding all else about the actual world fixed); if they sampled a world in which focal = 1, 
# they evaluate whether focal is, in general, sufficient (allowing other variables to vary)."

# How to call effects 0,1 when there are 4 effects: do I split them up into path effect and choice effect?
