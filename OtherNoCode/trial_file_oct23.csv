instructions,,,,,,,,,,,,,,NEXT,,,Instructions,"In this study, you will first see a short biography of a character.  You then see the path they take around a neighbourhood, ending at one of two food trucks serving either hot dogs or pizza.  You are then asked to type what you think best explains their chosen path.  This will be repeated 8 times.  When you are ready, please press the button below to see an example of the character's path.",,
practice,intro bio,introduction 1,,,,.png,,,,0 -250; 0 0,,,,NEXT,"In each trial, you will first be shown a short biography about a character and a bird's eye image that shows their starting position.  Importantly, the houses in the middle obstruct the character's initial view of the food trucks.  For instance, in the example below, the character can initially see the hot dog stand but <i>cannot</i> see the pizza stand. Even if they are almost at the corner, they still can't see round the corner. They have to be on the same side as the truck to see it.",above,,,,
