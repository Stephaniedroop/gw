# These model predictions are raw and do not account for some variables being unobserved.
# Now treat them for actual causality and unobservability in script `modpred_processing.R`

# -------------- Others, lesioned ------------------

# 1. Run model again with chance params to see if people are better modelled with no probabilities.
# 2. Noactual - in a processing script, then fit in 20x .Rmd as before
# 3. For various lesions of the cp: Can probably be done in the data later also, as we only calculate the raw cesm then treat it later
