Shortest path to his distation,,,,,,,,
He doesn't want to do any unnecessary steps and to get their asap,,,,,,,,
He wants to do some exercise before having his food.,,,,,,,,
"He might have believed that the other path was shorter, or mayhbe the road was blocked.",,,,,,,,

He is sporty and wanted to go for a long walk to see what is out there.,,,,,,,,

He knows what he likes and went straight to the hot dog stand.,,,,,,,,
He wanted to see what other food stands were around so he walked around the neighbourhood.,,,,,,,,
Adrian couldn't see where the pizza stand was.  He is lazy but as he didn't know the area well probably chose a route at random.  Unfortunately he chose wrongly and went the long way which wouldn't fit in well with his lazyness so route was an unfortunate choice of chance.,,,,,,,,
Parker's favourite food is hot dogs so he would head for the hot dog stand.  He is lazy and can see the stand from his starting location so he chose the direct short route to the stand.,,,,,,,,
Although Jesse is sporty they probably really like hot dogs or were very hungry so went to the hot dog stand by the shortest route.,,,,,,,,
"Charlie is lazy so would want to reach the hot dog stand (favourite) by the shortest route, however it could not be seen from the starting location so it was probably due to Charlie knowing the area well that the shortest route was taken.",,,,,,,,
Drew is sporty and knows the area well so would know the shortest route to the hot dog stand (favourite) but the longer route was taken so Drew probably wanted a good amount of exercise before having a snack.,,,,,,,,
Brooklyn must like hot dogs and doesn't the area well so the route would probably be a guess as Brooklyn can't see the hot dog stand from the starting location.  The route was therefore probably just chance as I would have expected a sporty person to perhaps prefer the longer route for a workout.,,,,,,,,
Taylor's favourite food is hot dogs and Taylor knows the area well.  I'd guess that Taylor headed for the pizza stand by the long route for the workout as they are sporty.  Taylor maybe was tired of having hot dogs or wanted a change so had a pizza instead.,,,,,,,,
Harper would be able to see the hot dog stand from the starting location.  They don't know the area well and are lazy.  It would make sense to go by the shortest path but the long route was taken so maybe they wanted to check on other food options before heading for the hot dog stand.,,,,,,,,

"He's sporty so he took the longer route, he probably thought there were more food trucks on the road.",,,,,,,,
They went there because that's their favorite food.,,,,,,,,
They wanted to get some exercise in and only then go to the hot dog stand because they are sporty.,,,,,,,,
He didn't feel like getting a pizza so he opted to go buy a hot dog instead.,,,,,,,,
"They didn't like the hot dog stand, so they decided to keep walking.",,,,,,,,
The pizza stand was the closest to them.,,,,,,,,
He didn't like the menu of the pizza stand so he decided to keep walking.,,,,,,,,

"Taylor knew that the hot dog stand was closed, so went directly to the pizza stand instead.",,,,,,,,

"Charlie went for pizza but the pizza stand was closed, so he continued on to the hot dog stand.",,,,,,,,
"Drew likes hot dogs and was hungry, so took the most direct path.",,,,,,,,
Because he doesn't know the area well,,,,,,,,
because he likes pizza and would like to take a walk before going to the food truck,,,,,,,,
"because he doesnt know the area well, so randomly buy some food when walking around the area",,,,,,,,
because he know where the nearest food shop is,,,,,,,,
just happen to see a hot dog when when trying to familiarise the area,,,,,,,,
he just want around the area and ramdomly bought some food before going back,,,,,,,,
"walking around the area and happened to see his favourite food, so bought it",,,,,,,,
"because he's lazy, so go the the nearest shop",,,,,,,,
He didn't know the hot dog stand was there so he settled for pizza,,,,,,,,
He wanted to learn his way around the neighbourhood so he took the long route,,,,,,,,
He knew the hot dog stand was there and fancied a longer walk,,,,,,,,
He wanted to get to the hot dog stand with minimum effort involved,,,,,,,,
He wanted to see if there was another food stand around the corner and he didn't mind walking to investigate because he is sporty,,,,,,,,
He doesn't like hot dogs so he had to walk longer until he found a food stand he didn't mind eating at,,,,,,,,
"He wanted a long walk more than he wanted his favourite food, so he walked longer and had pizza instead",,,,,,,,
He likes pizza the best and was already nearby so he went there,,,,,,,,
it was the quickest route,,,,,,,,
they wanted pizza,,,,,,,,
he went to the closest vendor,,,,,,,,
he wanted the exercise,,,,,,,,
he wanted a walk,,,,,,,,
he wanted hot dogs,,,,,,,,
he wanted a walk and pizza,,,,,,,,
they wanted exercise before the hot dogs,,,,,,,,
The pizza shop is probably healthier as he is sporty so probably healthy,,,,,,,,
it was in his view and because he is lazy he will go for the first thing he finds,,,,,,,,
initially because they are lazy they wanted to go to hotdogs because it was in their view. However they probably changed their mind so then went to pizzas,,,,,,,,
they know the hotdog is there and its his favourite so took the shortest route probably because he was very hungry,,,,,,,,
wanted to try the pizza but changed their mind so went for hotdogs as its their favourite,,,,,,,,
They saw the pizza shop but probably wanted to go around to see if there is anything else. Probably didnt like the hotdogs that were given in the hotdog shop so they went all the way round back to the pizza as they preffer that,,,,,,,,
they are just extremely lazy and wanted to go for the first thing they saw,,,,,,,,
they preffer hotdog instead of pizza,,,,,,,,
They wanted to get to know the area and took the long way,,,,,,,,

They were too lazy to go any further,,,,,,,,
They decided to get to know the area,,,,,,,,
He has decided to try and be better by getting fit,,,,,,,,
They were sporty so didn't mind walking until they found their favourite food,,,,,,,,
They could see the food stand so just went to that as it would be easiest,,,,,,,,
He knew the area and knew exactly what he wanted so went directly to it,,,,,,,,
The hotdog stand was closed,,,,,,,,
They decided to walk in the opposite direction to the food they could see as they really wanted hotdogs,,,,,,,,
He fancied a change from hotdogs,,,,,,,,
They were prepared to keep walking until they found exactly what they wanted as they were sporty and fit,,,,,,,,
Charlie does not like hot dogs and he has taken the shortest route to the pizza stand.,,,,,,,,
It is the quickest route from his starting point and also he can see the stand from there.,,,,,,,,
Drew is sporty and wanted the execise so took the longest route. Also he couldnt see the hotdog stand from his starting point.,,,,,,,,
Jesse does not know the area well so may be afraid of getting lost. He cannot see the hot dog stand from his starting point so has settled for pizza instead.,,,,,,,,
Taylor is sporty and enjoys the exercise hence him taking the longest route. He has decided to have pizza as an alternative.,,,,,,,,
I am not sure because the route selected contradicts one of the stated characteristice. The best explanantion is that he wasn't sure of the area and maybe also thought that there would be a better hot dog van around the corner.,,,,,,,,
Brooklyn is taking the long route round in order to investigate the area and also check out other food outlets in his area (as the hotdog van wasn't in his sight),,,,,,,,
Adrian is unsure of the area and therefore did not know the quickest route to take. Also I am assuming that he does not like hot dogs and prefers pizza.,,,,,,,,
They could see the Hot dog stand and could get to it quickly,,,,,,,,
They got lost or distracted as they passed the hot dog stall or someone told them there was a pizza stall round the corner.,,,,,,,,
He got lost or someone told him there was a hot dog stall around the corner,,,,,,,,
Taylor wanted some exercise and took the long route to the hot dog stall.,,,,,,,,
Someone told him there was a pizza stall around the corner and he wanted something different from hot dogs.,,,,,,,,

He loves Pizza and sees the stall and just goes to that stall.,,,,,,,,
"Drew wants some exercise and goes a long way, finally stopping at the pizza stall.",,,,,,,,
He decided to choose hotdogs because they are his favourite food.,,,,,,,,

"Adrian didn't want to eat pizza, so decided to wander around and see if anything else was available.",,,,,,,,

they could not be bothered to look around for the hot dog place even though it is their favourite,,,,,,,,
They did not know the area so did not know which way to go but were willing to look around for the hot dog place,,,,,,,,
they knew this was the shortest path to their favourite food,,,,,,,,
"they wanted to take a long route on purpose, so despite passing their favourite food they wanted to walk/run a bit further",,,,,,,,
they decided to stop being lazy for once and took the long route,,,,,,,,
they went to the pizza place but decided they wanted hot dogs instead,,,,,,,,

They are sporty and wanted the most amount of exercise possible,,,,,,,,
They didnt want a hot dog,,,,,,,,

He is lazy and so he has chosen the path which is the quickest and easiest to get to the pizza truck,,,,,,,,
"He didn't know which direction to go in and could probably see the hotdog stand from where he was, so chose that path",,,,,,,,
"Whilst he is lazy, he wanted to explore the area to get to know it a bit better and held out for pizza",,,,,,,,
"He didnt know a quicker or faster route to get to the hotdog stand, he must have seen the pizza stand and thought there would be a simular seller with hotdogs close by so kept going",,,,,,,,

"He is lazy, knows the area well and so has chosen the quickest path to his favourite food-hotdogs",,,,,,,,
"He couldnt see the hotdogs from he was and as he doesnt know the area well, he went in the wrong direction and settled for pizza",,,,,,,,
"Being sporty, he has chosen to take the longest route, as he knows the area well, and has gotten extra exercise, ending with his favourite food",,,,,,,,
Parker knew that the hot dog stand was nearby but decided to see what was around the corner.,,,,,,,,
Adrian took the quickest route purely by chance as he didn't know the area well.,,,,,,,,
Harper found the hot dog stand quickly as it was very close by despite the fact that they did not know the area well.,,,,,,,,

"They do not know the area as well as they think they do because, despite being lazy, they took the longer route to the hot dog stand rather than just simply walking down the street to it.",,,,,,,,
They chose the most convenient place (i.e. the first place they stumbled across) to get food because they do not know where they are and are too lazy to explore further.,,,,,,,,
"Because they don't know the area well and are also lazy they opted to go to the first food stand they came across, the pizza stand.",,,,,,,,
"Despite being able to see the pizza stand from where they began, their sporty side took over and they decided to go the long way around to work up an appetite before having some pizza.",,,,,,,,
"As the two food stands are relatively equidistant from where they began, the fact that they are sporty didn't really impact on their chosen route and they simply went to the food stand selling what they wanted most at the time. In this instance, pizza.",,,,,,,,
"As they are sporty, they chose to bypass the pizza stand despite not knowing the area well to get some extra exercise in, stopping at the hot dog stand when they were finished.",,,,,,,,

Adrian is quite lazy.,,,,,,,,
Even though it says they are lazy maybe they wanted to get more exercise or they thought about having pizza as a change but carried on to the hot dog stand as they realized they didn't really fancy a change after all,,,,,,,,
"He didn't mind walking, he doesn't know the area so took a gamble and it was the long way round. Also he would have seen the pizza cart and maybe thought another eating cart would be nearby",,,,,,,,
He couldn't be bothered to walk that far for a hotdog and he was hungry so decided on pizza as it was closer,,,,,,,,
They didn't fancy the hot dog when they got there so decided to carry on going and go back to the pizza cart not much difference in carrying on going or doubling back,,,,,,,,
They wanted a hotdog and they went by the shortest route,,,,,,,,
He saw the hot dogs and went for the first cart she could see,,,,,,,,
"Changed their mind, they knew the pizza place was further on but went to the hot dogs first and then carried on",,,,,,,,

The food truck was very close.,,,,,,,,

before going to eat your hot dog way to clear your mind a little,,,,,,,,
He went for a walk and they gave him some hot dogs.,,,,,,,,
Today it provokes him to eat pizza and he stopped to eat it.,,,,,,,,
He went to eat his favorite food and it's close to him.,,,,,,,,
His favorite food is hot dogs but this time he wanted to give pizzas a try.,,,,,,,,
"Charlie must like hotdogs, we can deduce this as he walked a longer distance to get hot dogs from a stand he could not see, while he could initially see and was closer to the pizza cart, that means his preference for hot dogs is even greater than his lazyness.",,,,,,,,
"Even though harpers favourite food is hot dogs and he's lazy he chose to ignore them and walk a much further distance to walk to the pizza stand, it is possible he's trying to offset the calories of the food he will eat by walking further.",,,,,,,,
"Drew took the long way around to the pizza stand on the road where he started out, this is because he is sporty and enjoys the exercise from the increased distance travelled.",,,,,,,,

I made him eat hot dog and he stopped to do it.,,,,,,,,
"He saw that the pizza stand was there but he preferred to go for a walk to see what else he saw, today his favorite food, which is hot dogs, didn't bother him and he turned around to eat the pizzas.",,,,,,,,
He wanted to eat pizza and he stopped to do it.,,,,,,,,
"I end up eating his favorite food, which is pizza.",,,,,,,,

He got lost and missed the hot dog caravan because he is not familiar with the area,,,,,,,,
He wanted some pizza and realised that he went to the wrong food caravan at the hot dog caravan then he left for the pizza caravan,,,,,,,,
He was lazy to look for the hot dog caravan and decided to go to the nearest,,,,,,,,
He is a true sportsman.,,,,,,,,
He played it safe and pizza was the safest thing to do even though hot dogs are his favorite food.,,,,,,,,
I don't think hot dogs are his favorite food,,,,,,,,

"He went out for a jog and after he finished he ate hot dogs, which is his favorite food.",,,,,,,,

They are too lazy to walk to the hot dog stand.,,,,,,,,
They fancied pizza and a walk.,,,,,,,,
They don't know the area well so went walking in a random direction and had pizza when they saw the truck.,,,,,,,,
They fancied hot dogs rather than pizza.,,,,,,,,
They went to the hot dog stand because they love hot dogs. They took the long route because they are sporty.,,,,,,,,
They fancied pizza but took the long route as they are sporty.,,,,,,,,
They decided to walk round the whole block to get to know the area and then get hot dogs at the end - they knew the stand was there as they could see it at the start.,,,,,,,,
They are sporty so decided to go explore the area and then when they saw the hot dog stand they bought hot dogs as they are their favourite food.,,,,,,,,
I was hungry and the closest thing in sight is the pizzeria.,,,,,,,,
He walked through the area and saw a pizzeria and it provoked him and he stopped to eat.,,,,,,,,
Before eating hot dog he wanted to walk around the entire neighborhood to see what was new and ended up eating hot dog afterwards.,,,,,,,,
"He walked to see his favorite food and as soon as he saw it, he didn't doubt it, he ate his hot dog.",,,,,,,,
"Before eating pizza he jogged for a while because he is sporty, then with the pizza he regained energy, this time he didn't want to eat his favorite food, which is hot dog.",,,,,,,,

that they are sporty,,,,,,,,
that brooklyn is sporty,,,,,,,,
that he is lazy,,,,,,,,
that they are lazy,,,,,,,,
that they are sporty,,,,,,,,
To eat a delicious pizza.,,,,,,,,
I think it's not lazy because I walk a long way and ignore the pizza truck.,,,,,,,,
Laziness outweighed his desire to eat his favorite food.,,,,,,,,
Taylor does know what it's like to go for her favorite food.,,,,,,,,
"He saw the pizza truck from the beginning, saw the hot dog truck along the way and still ended up eating pizza, I don't think the hot dog is his favorite food.",,,,,,,,
he wanted to eat the first food he could get.,,,,,,,,
"Hurrah, Jesse went to eat his favorite food.",,,,,,,,

"His favorite food is hot dogs, but this time he went for a walk and when he saw the pizzeria he decided to take advantage and eat something else.",,,,,,,,
He saw the hot dog stand and couldn't resist seeing his favorite food.,,,,,,,,
In my own opinion its because its the quickest route,,,,,,,,
I think Brooklyn choose this path because he might find someone to show him to the right path,,,,,,,,
Adrian doesn't know the area too well but paraventure got to his destination,,,,,,,,
because its the fastest route to the get the sales point,,,,,,,,
Charlie is just been lazy but still find a way to get to sales point,,,,,,,,
They took the longest route to the pizza shop because they don't know the area but were still able to figure it out.,,,,,,,,
Drew took the particular area because he knows the area very well,,,,,,,,
Harper took the route because he does not know the area and he's been lazy,,,,,,,,
A need to learn the area for the future.,,,,,,,,
He took the long way round for the exercise before rewarding himself.,,,,,,,,
He wanted to eat something different as he eats hot dogs all the time.,,,,,,,,
He wanted to eat a hot dog and it was no further than the pizza stand.,,,,,,,,
"They wanted a hot dog and not knowing the area well, didn't want to get lost or lose their way back to the hot dog stand.",,,,,,,,
They took the long way round for the exercise and then rewarded themselves with their favourite food.,,,,,,,,
He doesn't know the area and also doesn't want pizza so he kept going in search of something more preferable.,,,,,,,,
He doesn't know where other food options might be so he goes to the first one he sees.,,,,,,,,
He went straight to the pizza cart as thats what he wanted to eat.,,,,,,,,
He went for a walk then decided to get pizza instead of his favourite food.,,,,,,,,
They were hungry and found a pizza cart when they were walking around.,,,,,,,,
He loves hotdogs so he went straight to the hotdog cart.,,,,,,,,
He didnt know the area so went the long way to get his hotdog.,,,,,,,,
He wanted pizza but went the longer way to get it.,,,,,,,,
He was walking and felt like hotdogs as he walked past the cart.,,,,,,,,
He was out for a run and seen a hotdog stand at the end so he got them.,,,,,,,,
Charlie really wants hot dogs today,,,,,,,,
They don't have time for a long route or to get to their favourite food today,,,,,,,,
They want a longer trip to get some exercise,,,,,,,,
They really want pizza today,,,,,,,,
They remained hopeful there would be a hot dog stand despite going past the pizza stand,,,,,,,,
They want a long route for exercise,,,,,,,,
They stop at the first food stand they reach,,,,,,,,
They stop at the first food stand they encounter which just happens to be a favourite food,,,,,,,,
I was looking for something different to eat but ended up eating hot dogs...,,,,,,,,
He did not complicate and ate in the piz truck...,,,,,,,,
His desire to do sport made him walk for a long time...,,,,,,,,
"Wrong, hot dogs are not his favorite food...",,,,,,,,
"In order not to walk so much, he went to get the hot dog truck...",,,,,,,,
Maybe if he had known the location of the hot dog truck he wouldn't have eaten pizza...,,,,,,,,
"Wrong, this guy is not lazy...",,,,,,,,
"That's right, his favorite food is hot dogs...",,,,,,,,
The hotdog stand was closer,,,,,,,,
they wanted to get pizza,,,,,,,,
they don't know the area very well and didn't want hotdogs,,,,,,,,
They know the area and wanted to get hotdogs,,,,,,,,
they were hungry and stopped at the first food stand,,,,,,,,
they saw the stand and they were hungry,,,,,,,,
they don't know the area well and didn't want pizza,,,,,,,,
They wanted to go on a walk before getting food,,,,,,,,
Brooklyn likes pizza more and did not mind walking for a longer period of time (as he is sporty) to find a truck that sold a more suitable food for his liking.,,,,,,,,
He tried to find a closer place to get some food as he is lazy,,,,,,,,
He was willing to walk a long way in order to find his favourite food and didn't mind doing that because he was sporty,,,,,,,,
Parker could have eaten  too many hot dogs and decided to eat something else instead of his favourite food,,,,,,,,
he saw his favourite food and went for it,,,,,,,,
he didn't mind walking for a long time becuase he is sporty in order to get another type of food than pizza,,,,,,,,
he might have been starving and decided to placate his appetite with hot dogs,,,,,,,,
Charlie took the long way to get to the hot dog truck because he knew a drug delear and wanted to purchase some recreational drugs there.,,,,,,,,
"Adrian is described as being lazy but goes all the way around, walking past the pizza store. This suggests that he does not like pizza and continued until he got to the hot dog store.",,,,,,,,
"Jesse enjoys hot dogs and can't see the stand from his starting point. Considering that they are his favourite, he decides to go and look for them.",,,,,,,,
"Parker's favourite food is hot dogs but he decides to head to the pizza stand. He is lazy and the pizza store is closer so decides to go there due to being lazy. Also, just because hot dogs are his favourite doesn't mean he also doesn't love pizza.",,,,,,,,
Charlie is lazy and sees the hot dog stand in his vicinity so decides to go there instead of going on the walk to the pizza stand.,,,,,,,,
"Drew can't see the pizza stand but knows the area so skips past the hot dog stand. Being sporty, this wouldn't be an issue as he doesn't mind the extra distance. Also, he may simply enjoy pizza more.",,,,,,,,
Taylor wants hot dogs and knows the area well so has no problem travelling for his favourite food.,,,,,,,,
"Brooklyn is new to the area but can't see the hot dog stand. However, because they are sporty, they continue towards the pizza stand. Taylor may not enjoy hot dogs and also may have no problem in new surroundings.",,,,,,,,
"Harper loves hot dogs but decides to go past the stand and return to the pizza stand. Considering they are unknown to the area and considered lazy this is pretty interesting. The hot dog stand may have been closed, may have been busy or too expensive.",,,,,,,,
Jesse happened to see a hot dog stand selling her favourite food and must have been hungry.,,,,,,,,
Drew must have known where each food stand was because he knows the area.  He must have set himself the goal of walking or maybe jogging a distance and then rewarding himself.,,,,,,,,
Maybe Brooklyn didn't like the look of the pizza stand and decided to press on until she found something else.,,,,,,,,
Harper is lazy but still managed to take the longest route until he found his favourite.  Maybe he just decided to walk anit clockwise until he found something he wanted.,,,,,,,,
Maybe he doesn't like hot dogs or wasn't hungry enough to eat until he found the pizza stand.,,,,,,,,
It makes sense if he knows the area and wanted a hot dog that he would take the shortest route as he is lazy.,,,,,,,,
Maybe the pizza stand was slightly less distance to walk.  He knew where it was so maybe he had this in mind.,,,,,,,,
He wanted to do some exercise and resisted the temptation of having a hot dog.,,,,,,,,
Charlie went the quickest route to the hot dog stand because he knows where the hot dog stand is situated as he knows the area well.,,,,,,,,
Jesse could see a hot dog stand on the corner and went to investigate.,,,,,,,,
As Taylor knows the area well he decided to take a longer route to the hot dog stand so he could get some exercise.,,,,,,,,
Drew knows the area well so he went a slightly longer route to the pizza stand to get some exercise before he has something to eat.,,,,,,,,
As Adrian doesn't know the area well he went a walk looking for a hot dog stand and eventually found one.,,,,,,,,
Brooklyn doesn't know the area well and as he was feeling a wee bit hungry he spotted the pizza stand close by and thought he would give it a try.,,,,,,,,
As Harper does not know the area well he went for a walk to see if he could find a hot dog stand and he eventually did.,,,,,,,,
Parker favourite food is hot dogs so when he fancies a hot dog he goes to a hot dog stand just along the road.,,,,,,,,
The hot dog stand was quicker to get to as Adrian is lazy.,,,,,,,,
As Brooklyn is sporty he was happy to walk the extra distance to what I'd guess was his preferred food of hot dogs.,,,,,,,,
I think Charlie despite being lazy likes pizza a lot more than hot dogs so is prepared to walk further knowing where he can find his food of choice.,,,,,,,,
The fact that Taylor likes hot dogs a lot.,,,,,,,,
"Not knowing the area well, Harper went for food at the only place he could see it.",,,,,,,,
Jesse wanted to earn his fast food by going on a long walk first as he is sporty.,,,,,,,,
I think maybe Harper didn't have any money but knowing the area well would know where a cash machine was and then made his way to his favourite food of hot dogs.,,,,,,,,
I think Drew prefers pizza and knows where he can find it.,,,,,,,,
"Boredom, he took the longer way because he's bored",,,,,,,,
He wanted to challenge himself because he's sporty,,,,,,,,
They changed their mind and chose pizza,,,,,,,,
Their favourite food is hot dogs,,,,,,,,
He didn't feel like doing too much today,,,,,,,,
They decided not to be lazy,,,,,,,,
He went that way on a whim,,,,,,,,
They wanted a sporty challenge,,,,,,,,
Harper loves Hotdogs and wanted them at that moment. Harper is not too fond of Pizza so opted to stick with his favourite food.,,,,,,,,
"Drew doesn't mind trying different foods, however on this occasion he opted for Pizza. As he knows the area well de decided to bypass hotdogs for pizza.",,,,,,,,
Adrian considered hotdogs but when he reached the stand he changed his mind. He knew where the pizza stand was because of where he began his route. So he decided to have pizza instead of hotdogs.,,,,,,,,
Brooklyn opted for hotdogs due to have weak understand of the area. Brooklyn must have thought there may not be a food stand nearby and must have been hungry.,,,,,,,,
"Taylor must've altered his mind when he approached his favourite food. Knowing the area well, Taylor decided to have Pizza instead as it is around the corner.",,,,,,,,
Charlie opted for Pizza over Hotdogs. Pizza was more nearby and due to Charlie being lazy it would have been the ideal choice for Charlie.,,,,,,,,
"Parker wanted his favourite food, even though he is lazy the difference from Pizza to hotdog would'nt have exerted much of his energy.",,,,,,,,
"Although favourite food is hotdog, Jesse decided to try something else in the area of unknown. Jess was feeling adventurous and thought let us see where this path leads to. Jesse eventually arrived at Pizza stand and decided to have that instead.",,,,,,,,
Taylor is very hungry,,,,,,,,
I am not sure with this one at all!,,,,,,,,
Brooklyn wants to take exercise to get his food,,,,,,,,
Charlie likes hotdogs,,,,,,,,
Charlie is lazy,,,,,,,,
Drew prefers hotdogs,,,,,,,,
Harper prefers hotdogs,,,,,,,,
Jesse wants to exercise to enjoy his hotdogs,,,,,,,,
This person went to the pizza stand,,,,,,,,
Jesse does not know the route well of the area that it why  he passed his favourite spot.,,,,,,,,
Brooklyn is finding his way aound the area,,,,,,,,
Taylor got his favourite spot in the area,,,,,,,,
Parker probably want to see the environment properly,,,,,,,,
Charlie walks around the area to site see the environment,,,,,,,,
Drew is trying to know his favourite spot,,,,,,,,
The easiest way to get his favorite spot,,,,,,,,
"As Brooklyn don't know the area well, they may have wanted to see what options they had, other than pizza, but then after having walked around the houses and seen the other option, decided to go to the pizza truck.",,,,,,,,
"Although Charlie is lazy, he knows the area well and so it's likely he knew where the hot dog truck was and decided to walk around the houses to the hot dog truck to get his preffered meal.",,,,,,,,
"Adrian does not know the area well, and couldn't see either option of truck. He started walking in the direction of the pizza truck and when he reaches it, he stops and doesn't consider exploring further as he is lazy.",,,,,,,,
The hot dog truck may have been closed as they are Parker's favourite food and he walked straight passed it.,,,,,,,,
"Taylor would know there is a hot dog truck round the on the next corner, and does not seem to be lazy. I think it is likely that Taylor just wanted pizza this day.",,,,,,,,
"Drew knew their was a hot dog van on the next corner, and whilst they were near the pizza van, decided to walk to the hot dog van as this is what he wanted to eat on this occasion.",,,,,,,,
Harper started walking in one direction as they don't know the area well and were lucky to find this truck sold hot dogs which are their favourite food.,,,,,,,,
Jesse is sporty and so walked around the block of houses to see what options they had. They stopped at the hot dog truck as they sell their favourite food.,,,,,,,,
Jesse was so hungry that he decided to buy food from the first truck he saw. He doesn't know the area enough to know where the hot dog stand is based.,,,,,,,,
"Adrian dislikes hotdogs to the point that he would rather avoid them, even when he considers himself lazy.",,,,,,,,
Parker loves hotdogs and he knows where the hot dog stand is.,,,,,,,,
"Because Harper didn't know where the hot dog stand was, he took the long way around to it. But from their point of view, they continued walking until they found something familiar.",,,,,,,,
I believe Taylor wasn't wearing their glasses when they went out for a jog. That would explain why he didn't stop at the hot dog stand even though his favourite food is hot dogs.,,,,,,,,
Brooklyn simply explored the area and discovered a hot dog stand that captured their eye.,,,,,,,,
Drew likes walking outside and since he's sporty. He considers it a fun activity. He took a break at the hot dog stand to have a hot dog as a snack before he went on another walk around his neighbourhood.,,,,,,,,
Charlie lives on pizza and knows that the location is around the corner. So he goes there to get his favourite treat.,,,,,,,,
They are lazy,,,,,,,,
They dont know the area,,,,,,,,
They wanted to exercise,,,,,,,,
Their favourite food is hot dogs,,,,,,,,
They don't know the area well,,,,,,,,
They wanted to exercise,,,,,,,,
Their favourite food is pizza,,,,,,,,
They are lazy,,,,,,,,
Because Drew knows his way around he is familiar with the food van placement and being a sporty fellow thought he would get some exercise by taking the long way round,,,,,,,,
"Adrian, in an attempt to find something to eat, got lost because he doean't know the area and had to take the long way round to the pizza cart. Being a lazy fellow, he would have eaten hot dogs but unfortunately the vendor had sold out.",,,,,,,,
"Harper, not knowing the area well spots a pizza pop-up eatery down the street and asks the vendor where the nearest hot dog stand is situated because they are his favourite food. However he is lazy and doean't want to walk far, but the hunger for hot dogs got the better of him and he takes a walk to the stand",,,,,,,,
Taylor takes his daily stroll to the hot dog stand at the end of his street to consume his favourite food. The vendor has promised to take a hot dog to the pizza seller around the corner and knowing Taylor is a sporty individual offers him a half price hot dog if he delivers another hot dog to the pizza seller.,,,,,,,,
"Parker was caught in two minds. Being a lazy fellow his preference is to not expend too much energy and to hit the pizza stall, but his favouirite food are hot dogs and the stand is only a little further than the pizza stall. It was a close call but the hot dogs reign supreme in this case",,,,,,,,
Charlie is particularly hungry today and the smell from the pizza cart has him salivating and with the cart only being two houses away he doesn't have to expend too much energy.,,,,,,,,
