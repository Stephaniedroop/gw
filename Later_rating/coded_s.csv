He knows what he likes and went straight to the hot dog stand.,1,,1,,,,,,,
He wanted to see what other food stands were around so he walked around the neighbourhood.,,,,1,,,,,,
Adrian couldn't see where the pizza stand was.  He is lazy but as he didn't know the area well probably chose a route at random.  Unfortunately he chose wrongly and went the long way which wouldn't fit in well with his lazyness so route was an unfortunate choice of chance.,,1,1,1,,,,,,
Parker's favourite food is hot dogs so he would head for the hot dog stand.  He is lazy and can see the stand from his starting location so he chose the direct short route to the stand.,1,1,,1,,,,,,

Brooklyn must like hot dogs and doesn't the area well so the route would probably be a guess as Brooklyn can't see the hot dog stand from the starting location.

Taylor's favourite food is hot dogs and Taylor knows the area well.  I'd guess that Taylor headed for the pizza stand by the long route for the workout as they are sporty.  Taylor maybe was tired of having hot dogs or wanted a change so had a pizza instead.,1,1,1,,1,,,,,
Harper would be able to see the hot dog stand from the starting location.  They don't know the area well and are lazy.  It would make sense to go by the shortest path but the long route was taken so maybe they wanted to check on other food options before heading for the hot dog stand.,,1,1,1,,,,,,

They were not aware of the hot dog stand around the corner as they are unfamiliar with the area,,,1,,,,,,,
he chose this path as its a shorter distance and couldnt be bothered to walk further,,,,,,,,,,
Although he couldnt be bothered to walk the distance it was worth it for his favorite food,1,,,,,,,,,

He didn't feel like getting a pizza so he opted to go buy a hot dog instead.,1,,,,,,,,,
"They didn't like the hot dog stand, so they decided to keep walking.",1,,,,,,,,,
The pizza stand was the closest to them.,,,,1,,,,,,
He didn't like the menu of the pizza stand so he decided to keep walking.,1,,,,,,,,,
They decided to try something new and walk to the pizza stand instead.,,,,,,,,,,
"Parker got to the hot dog stand using the most direct route but found that they were out of stock, so he continued on to the pizza stand instead.",,,,,,,,,,
"Taylor knew that the hot dog stand was closed, so went directly to the pizza stand instead.",,,,1,,,,1,,
"Brooklyn decided to explore since he is sporty to see what he could find. Either the hot dog stand was closed or he really doesn't like hot dogs, so ended up back at the pizza stand.",1,1,,1,,,1,1,,
"Adrian doesn't like hot dogs, so went exploring to see whether he could find something different.",1,,,1,,,,,,
Jesse decided to explore the area to see what was around before stopping for their favourite food.,1,,,,,,1,,,

"Charlie went for pizza but the pizza stand was closed, so he continued on to the hot dog stand.",,,,1,,,,1,,

"because he doesnt know the area well, so randomly buy some food when walking around the area",,,1,,,,,,,
because he know where the nearest food shop is,,,1,1,,,,,,
just happen to see a hot dog when when trying to familiarise the area,,,1,1,,,,,,

"walking around the area and happened to see his favourite food, so bought it",1,,1,1,,,,,,
"because he's lazy, so go the the nearest shop",,1,,1,,,,,,

He wanted to learn his way around the neighbourhood so he took the long route,,,,,,,1,,,
He knew the hot dog stand was there and fancied a longer walk,,,1,,1,,,,,
He wanted to get to the hot dog stand with minimum effort involved,,,,,,,,,,
He wanted to see if there was another food stand around the corner and he didn't mind walking to investigate because he is sporty,,1,,1,,,,,,
He doesn't like hot dogs so he had to walk longer until he found a food stand he didn't mind eating at,1,,,,,,,,,
"He wanted a long walk more than he wanted his favourite food, so he walked longer and had pizza instead",,,,,1,,,,,
He likes pizza the best and was already nearby so he went there,1,,,1,,,,,,
it was the quickest route,,,,,,,,,,
they wanted pizza,,,,,1,,,,,
he went to the closest vendor,,,,1,,,,,,
he wanted the exercise,,,,,,1,,,,
he wanted a walk,,,,,,,,,,
he wanted hot dogs,,,,,1,,,,,
he wanted a walk and pizza,,,,,1,,,,,
they wanted exercise before the hot dogs,,,,,,1,,,,
The pizza shop is probably healthier as he is sporty so probably healthy,,1,,,,,,,,
it was in his view and because he is lazy he will go for the first thing he finds,,1,,,,,,,,
initially because they are lazy they wanted to go to hotdogs because it was in their view. However they probably changed their mind so then went to pizzas,,1,,,1,,,,,
they know the hotdog is there and its his favourite so took the shortest route probably because he was very hungry,1,,1,,,,,,,
wanted to try the pizza but changed their mind so went for hotdogs as its their favourite,1,,,,1,,,,,
They saw the pizza shop but probably wanted to go around to see if there is anything else. Probably didnt like the hotdogs that were given in the hotdog shop so they went all the way round back to the pizza as they preffer that,1,,,1,,,,,,
they are just extremely lazy and wanted to go for the first thing they saw,,1,,1,,,,,,
they preffer hotdog instead of pizza,,,,,,,,,,

They could see the food stand so just went to that as it would be easiest,,,,1,,,,,,
He knew the area and knew exactly what he wanted so went directly to it,,,1,,,,,,,
The hotdog stand was closed,,,,1,,,,1,,
They decided to walk in the opposite direction to the food they could see as they really wanted hotdogs,,,,1,1,,,,,
He fancied a change from hotdogs,,,,,1,,,,,
They were prepared to keep walking until they found exactly what they wanted as they were sporty and fit,,1,,,,,,,,
Charlie does not like hot dogs and he has taken the shortest route to the pizza stand.,1,,,,,,,,,
It is the quickest route from his starting point and also he can see the stand from there.,,,,1,,,,,,
Drew is sporty and wanted the execise so took the longest route. Also he couldnt see the hotdog stand from his starting point.,,1,,1,,,,,,
Jesse does not know the area well so may be afraid of getting lost. He cannot see the hot dog stand from his starting point so has settled for pizza instead.,,,1,1,,,,,,
Taylor is sporty and enjoys the exercise hence him taking the longest route. He has decided to have pizza as an alternative.,,1,,,,,,,,
I am not sure because the route selected contradicts one of the stated characteristice. The best explanantion is that he wasn't sure of the area and maybe also thought that there would be a better hot dog van around the corner.,,,1,,,,,,,
Brooklyn is taking the long route round in order to investigate the area and also check out other food outlets in his area (as the hotdog van wasn't in his sight),,,1,,,,,,,
Adrian is unsure of the area and therefore did not know the quickest route to take. Also I am assuming that he does not like hot dogs and prefers pizza.,1,,1,,,,,,,
They could see the Hot dog stand and could get to it quickly,,,,1,,,,,,
They got lost or distracted as they passed the hot dog stall or someone told them there was a pizza stall round the corner.,,,,,,,,,,
He got lost or someone told him there was a hot dog stall around the corner,,,,,,,,,,
Taylor wanted some exercise and took the long route to the hot dog stall.,,,,,,1,,,,
Someone told him there was a pizza stall around the corner and he wanted something different from hot dogs.,,,,,1,,,,,
He might have just wanted a hot dog and knew or was told there was a stall around the corner.,,,,,1,,,,,
He loves Pizza and sees the stall and just goes to that stall.,,,,1,,,,,,
"Drew wants some exercise and goes a long way, finally stopping at the pizza stall.",,,,,,1,,,,
He decided to choose hotdogs because they are his favourite food.,1,,,,,,,,,
Brooklyn prefers hotdogs over pizza.,1,,,,,,,,,
Taylor wnated to try something different to eat.,,,,,,,,,,
The pizza stand was the nearest option.,,,,1,,,,,,
It was the nearest option and Parkers favourite.,1,,,1,,,,,,

They did not know the area so did not know which way to go but were willing to look around for the hot dog place,,,1,,,,,,,
they knew this was the shortest path to their favourite food,1,,,,,,,,,

He is lazy and so he has chosen the path which is the quickest and easiest to get to the pizza truck,,1,,,,,,,,
"He didn't know which direction to go in and could probably see the hotdog stand from where he was, so chose that path",,,1,1,,,,,,
"Whilst he is lazy, he wanted to explore the area to get to know it a bit better and held out for pizza",,1,,,,,1,,,
"He didnt know a quicker or faster route to get to the hotdog stand, he must have seen the pizza stand and thought there would be a simular seller with hotdogs close by so kept going",,,1,1,,,,,,
"He has taken a longer route than normal due to being sporty, and has decided along the way that he doesnt want hotdogs today and therefore continues on to get pizza, whilst getting more exercise",,1,,,,,,,,

"Because they don't know the area well and are also lazy they opted to go to the first food stand they came across, the pizza stand.",,1,1,,,,,,,
"Despite being able to see the pizza stand from where they began, their sporty side took over and they decided to go the long way around to work up an appetite before having some pizza.",,1,,1,,,,,,
"As the two food stands are relatively equidistant from where they began, the fact that they are sporty didn't really impact on their chosen route and they simply went to the food stand selling what they wanted most at the time. In this instance, pizza.",,1,,,,,,,,
"As they are sporty, they chose to bypass the pizza stand despite not knowing the area well to get some extra exercise in, stopping at the hot dog stand when they were finished.",,1,1,,,,,,,

Even though it says they are lazy maybe they wanted to get more exercise or they thought about having pizza as a change but carried on to the hot dog stand as they realized they didn't really fancy a change after all,,1,,,,1,,,,
"He didn't mind walking, he doesn't know the area so took a gamble and it was the long way round. Also he would have seen the pizza cart and maybe thought another eating cart would be nearby",,,1,1,,,,,,
He couldn't be bothered to walk that far for a hotdog and he was hungry so decided on pizza as it was closer,,,,1,,,,,,
They didn't fancy the hot dog when they got there so decided to carry on going and go back to the pizza cart not much difference in carrying on going or doubling back,,,,,1,,,,,
They wanted a hotdog and they went by the shortest route,,,,,1,,,,,
He saw the hot dogs and went for the first cart she could see,,,,1,,,,,,

Better hot dogs than sports.,,,,,,,,,,

"He saw the hot dog stand, didn't want them because he doesn't really like them. On the way around he came across pizza, but hates it more, so carried on to the hot dog stand regretably",1,,,1,,,,,,
He might have asked someone for the direction.,,,,,,,,,,
He went there himself because he knew the area and moreover he was just a few distance away from the pizza truck.,,,1,,,,,,,
He muct have have been walking round the blocks searching for food trucks.,,,,,,,,,,
"Because he knew the area well, he walked to the location of the hot dogs truck.",,,1,,,,,,,
He must have gone visiting or doing something else at the other direction.,,,,,,,,,,
"Brooklyn must have wanted to just go for a walk and on his way, go to the hot dog truck.",,,,,,1,,,,
He must have decided not to come through the shorter route.,,,,,,,,,,

Brooklyn saw the pizza stand and went straight to it,,,,1,,,,,,
Really hungry and the pizza stand was in view,,,,,1,,,,,

"They know the area well and can see the hot dog, and it is close",,,1,1,,,,,,
"They are lazy so they will take the shortest route and go for the pizza, even though they prefer hot dogs.",1,1,,,,,,,,
"It would have been quicker to go for the hot dog, but perhaps they were unable to see it.",,,,1,,,,,,
"It is odd they took a longer route when they are lazy, but hot dog is their favourite food.",1,1,,,,,,,,
They only had to take a few steps to reach the pizza.,,,,1,,,,,,
"Jesse is sporty, so they wouldn't have minded going for the hot dog, even though it was further away.",,1,,,,,,,,

I chose that because it was the best path in sight.,,,,1,,,,,,
I guess he didn't have a clear vision of the road and that's why he made that turn.,,,,1,,,,,,
The food truck was very close.,,,,1,,,,,,
He didn't see the dog cart from that point where he was,,,,1,,,,,,

He went to eat his favorite food and it's close to him.,1,,,1,,,,,,
His favorite food is hot dogs but this time he wanted to give pizzas a try.,1,,,,1,,,,,
"Charlie must like hotdogs, we can deduce this as he walked a longer distance to get hot dogs from a stand he could not see, while he could initially see and was closer to the pizza cart, that means his preference for hot dogs is even greater than his lazyness.",1,1,,1,,,,,,
"Even though harpers favourite food is hot dogs and he's lazy he chose to ignore them and walk a much further distance to walk to the pizza stand, it is possible he's trying to offset the calories of the food he will eat by walking further.",1,1,,,,,,,,
"Drew took the long way around to the pizza stand on the road where he started out, this is because he is sporty and enjoys the exercise from the increased distance travelled.",,1,,,,,,,,

He chose the path to the nearest food caravan because he is lazy to walk,,1,,1,,,,,,
Drew took the longest route to the hot dog caravan because he wanted to exercise,,,,,,1,,,,
He got lost and missed the hot dog caravan because he is not familiar with the area,,,1,,,,,,,
He wanted some pizza and realised that he went to the wrong food caravan at the hot dog caravan then he left for the pizza caravan,,,,,1,,,,,

He is a true sportsman.,,1,,,,,,,,
He played it safe and pizza was the safest thing to do even though hot dogs are his favorite food.,1,,,,,,,,,
I don't think hot dogs are his favorite food,1,,,,,,,,,
Being lazy and eating pizza is not bad at all.,,1,,,,,,,,
I think it's not lazy.,,1,,,,,,,,
Hot dogs really are his favorite food.,1,,,,,,,,,
I think this guy was looking for a third option for lunch.,,,,,,,,1,,
A good hot dog makes us happy.,,,,,1,,,,,
"He went to eat what he likes most, hot dog.",1,,,,,,,,,
He walked through the area and saw the pizza stand and it provoked him.,,,1,1,,,,,,
He walked all over the area and stopped to eat pizza.,,,1,,,,,,,
He went out to play sports and while walking he saw a hot dog stand and stopped to eat.,,,,1,,,,,,
His favorite food is hot dogs but the pizza stand was next door and he stopped to eat pizza.,1,,,,,,,,,
He went around the entire area and saw a hot dog stand and stopped there to eat.,,,1,1,,,,,,

It's the first food place he sees.,,,,1,,,,,,
He went the long way round because he didn't know there was a shorter route.,,,1,,,,,,,

They decided to walk round the whole block to get to know the area and then get hot dogs at the end - they knew the stand was there as they could see it at the start.,,,1,1,,,,,,
They are sporty so decided to go explore the area and then when they saw the hot dog stand they bought hot dogs as they are their favourite food.,1,1,,1,,,1,,,
I was hungry and the closest thing in sight is the pizzeria.,,,,1,,,,,,
He walked through the area and saw a pizzeria and it provoked him and he stopped to eat.,,,1,1,,,,,,

that they are sporty,,1,,,,,,,,
To eat a delicious pizza.,,,,,,,,,,
I think it's not lazy because I walk a long way and ignore the pizza truck.,,1,,,,,,,,
Laziness outweighed his desire to eat his favorite food.,1,,,,,,,,,
Taylor does know what it's like to go for her favorite food.,1,,1,,,,,,,
"He saw the pizza truck from the beginning, saw the hot dog truck along the way and still ended up eating pizza, I don't think the hot dog is his favorite food.",1,,,1,,,,,,

"His favorite food is hot dogs, but this time he went for a walk and when he saw the pizzeria he decided to take advantage and eat something else.",1,,,1,,,,,,
He saw the hot dog stand and couldn't resist seeing his favorite food.,1,,,1,,,,,,
In my own opinion its because its the quickest route,,,,,,,,,,
I think Brooklyn choose this path because he might find someone to show him to the right path,,,,,,,,,,
Adrian doesn't know the area too well but paraventure got to his destination,,,1,,,,,,,
because its the fastest route to the get the sales point,,,,,,,,,,
Charlie is just been lazy but still find a way to get to sales point,,1,,,,,,,,
They took the longest route to the pizza shop because they don't know the area but were still able to figure it out.,,,1,,,,,,,
Drew took the particular area because he knows the area very well,,,1,,,,,,,
Harper took the route because he does not know the area and he's been lazy,,1,1,,,,,,,
A need to learn the area for the future.,,,1,,,,,,,
He took the long way round for the exercise before rewarding himself.,,,,,,1,,,,
He wanted to eat something different as he eats hot dogs all the time.,,,,,1,,,,,
He wanted to eat a hot dog and it was no further than the pizza stand.,,,,,1,,,,,
"They wanted a hot dog and not knowing the area well, didn't want to get lost or lose their way back to the hot dog stand.",,,1,,1,,,,,
They took the long way round for the exercise and then rewarded themselves with their favourite food.,1,,,,,,,,,
He doesn't know the area and also doesn't want pizza so he kept going in search of something more preferable.,1,,1,,,,,,,
He doesn't know where other food options might be so he goes to the first one he sees.,,,1,1,,,,,,
He went straight to the pizza cart as thats what he wanted to eat.,,,,,1,,,,,
He went for a walk then decided to get pizza instead of his favourite food.,1,,,,,,,,,

He was walking and felt like hotdogs as he walked past the cart.,1,,,,,,,,,
He was out for a run and seen a hotdog stand at the end so he got them.,,,,1,,,,,,
Charlie really wants hot dogs today,,,,,1,,,,,
They don't have time for a long route or to get to their favourite food today,1,,,,,,,,,
They want a longer trip to get some exercise,,,,,,1,,,,
They really want pizza today,,,,,1,,,,,
They remained hopeful there would be a hot dog stand despite going past the pizza stand,,,,,,,,,,
They want a long route for exercise,,,,,,1,,,,
They stop at the first food stand they reach,,,,,,,,,,
They stop at the first food stand they encounter which just happens to be a favourite food,1,,,,,,,,,
I was looking for something different to eat but ended up eating hot dogs...,,,,,,,,,,
He did not complicate and ate in the piz truck...,,,,,,,,,,
His desire to do sport made him walk for a long time...,,,,,,,,,,
"Wrong, hot dogs are not his favorite food...",1,,,,,,,,,
"In order not to walk so much, he went to get the hot dog truck...",,,,,,,,,,
Maybe if he had known the location of the hot dog truck he wouldn't have eaten pizza...,,,1,,,,,,,
"Wrong, this guy is not lazy...",,1,,,,,,,,
"That's right, his favorite food is hot dogs...",1,,,,,,,,,
The hotdog stand was closer,,,,1,,,,,,
they wanted to get pizza,,,,,1,,,,,
they don't know the area very well and didn't want hotdogs,,,1,,,,,,,
They know the area and wanted to get hotdogs,,,1,,1,,,,,
they were hungry and stopped at the first food stand,,,,,1,,,,,
they saw the stand and they were hungry,,,,1,,,,,,
they don't know the area well and didn't want pizza,,,1,,,,,,,
They wanted to go on a walk before getting food,,,,,,,,,,
Brooklyn likes pizza more and did not mind walking for a longer period of time (as he is sporty) to find a truck that sold a more suitable food for his liking.,1,1,,,,,,,,
He tried to find a closer place to get some food as he is lazy,,1,,1,,,,,,
He was willing to walk a long way in order to find his favourite food and didn't mind doing that because he was sporty,1,1,,,,,,,,
Parker could have eaten  too many hot dogs and decided to eat something else instead of his favourite food,1,,,,,,,,,
he saw his favourite food and went for it,1,,,1,,,,,,
he didn't mind walking for a long time becuase he is sporty in order to get another type of food than pizza,,1,,,,,,,,
he might have been starving and decided to placate his appetite with hot dogs,,,,,,,,,,
Charlie took the long way to get to the hot dog truck because he knew a drug delear and wanted to purchase some recreational drugs there.,,,1,,,,,,,
"Adrian is described as being lazy but goes all the way around, walking past the pizza store. This suggests that he does not like pizza and continued until he got to the hot dog store.",1,1,,,,,,,,
"Jesse enjoys hot dogs and can't see the stand from his starting point. Considering that they are his favourite, he decides to go and look for them.",1,,,1,,,,,,
"Parker's favourite food is hot dogs but he decides to head to the pizza stand. He is lazy and the pizza store is closer so decides to go there due to being lazy. Also, just because hot dogs are his favourite doesn't mean he also doesn't love pizza.",1,1,,1,,,,,,
Charlie is lazy and sees the hot dog stand in his vicinity so decides to go there instead of going on the walk to the pizza stand.,,1,,1,,,,,,
"Drew can't see the pizza stand but knows the area so skips past the hot dog stand. Being sporty, this wouldn't be an issue as he doesn't mind the extra distance. Also, he may simply enjoy pizza more.",,1,1,1,,,,,,
Taylor wants hot dogs and knows the area well so has no problem travelling for his favourite food.,1,,1,,,,,,,
"Brooklyn is new to the area but can't see the hot dog stand. However, because they are sporty, they continue towards the pizza stand. Taylor may not enjoy hot dogs and also may have no problem in new surroundings.",,1,1,1,,,,,,
"Harper loves hot dogs but decides to go past the stand and return to the pizza stand. Considering they are unknown to the area and considered lazy this is pretty interesting. The hot dog stand may have been closed, may have been busy or too expensive.",,1,1,1,,,,1,,
Jesse happened to see a hot dog stand selling her favourite food and must have been hungry.,1,,,1,,,,,,
Drew must have known where each food stand was because he knows the area.  He must have set himself the goal of walking or maybe jogging a distance and then rewarding himself.,,,1,,,,,,,
Maybe Brooklyn didn't like the look of the pizza stand and decided to press on until she found something else.,1,,,,,,,,,
Harper is lazy but still managed to take the longest route until he found his favourite.  Maybe he just decided to walk anit clockwise until he found something he wanted.,1,1,,,,,,,,
Maybe he doesn't like hot dogs or wasn't hungry enough to eat until he found the pizza stand.,1,,,,,,,,,
It makes sense if he knows the area and wanted a hot dog that he would take the shortest route as he is lazy.,,1,1,,,,,,,
Maybe the pizza stand was slightly less distance to walk.  He knew where it was so maybe he had this in mind.,,,1,,,,,,,
He wanted to do some exercise and resisted the temptation of having a hot dog.,,,,,,1,,,,
Charlie went the quickest route to the hot dog stand because he knows where the hot dog stand is situated as he knows the area well.,,,1,,,,,,,
Jesse could see a hot dog stand on the corner and went to investigate.,,,,1,,,,,,
As Taylor knows the area well he decided to take a longer route to the hot dog stand so he could get some exercise.,,,1,,,,,,,
Drew knows the area well so he went a slightly longer route to the pizza stand to get some exercise before he has something to eat.,,,1,,,,,,,
As Adrian doesn't know the area well he went a walk looking for a hot dog stand and eventually found one.,,,1,,,,,,,
Brooklyn doesn't know the area well and as he was feeling a wee bit hungry he spotted the pizza stand close by and thought he would give it a try.,,,1,1,,,,,,
As Harper does not know the area well he went for a walk to see if he could find a hot dog stand and he eventually did.,,,1,1,,,,,,
Parker favourite food is hot dogs so when he fancies a hot dog he goes to a hot dog stand just along the road.,1,,,,,,,,,
The hot dog stand was quicker to get to as Adrian is lazy.,,1,,,,,,,,
As Brooklyn is sporty he was happy to walk the extra distance to what I'd guess was his preferred food of hot dogs.,1,1,,,,,,,,
I think Charlie despite being lazy likes pizza a lot more than hot dogs so is prepared to walk further knowing where he can find his food of choice.,1,1,1,,,,,,,
The fact that Taylor likes hot dogs a lot.,1,,,,,,,,,
"Not knowing the area well, Harper went for food at the only place he could see it.",,,1,1,,,,,,
Jesse wanted to earn his fast food by going on a long walk first as he is sporty.,,1,,,,,,,,
I think maybe Harper didn't have any money but knowing the area well would know where a cash machine was and then made his way to his favourite food of hot dogs.,1,,1,,,,,,,
I think Drew prefers pizza and knows where he can find it.,1,,1,,,,,,,
"Boredom, he took the longer way because he's bored",,,,,1,1,,,,
He wanted to challenge himself because he's sporty,,1,,,,,,,,
They changed their mind and chose pizza,,,,,1,,,,,
Their favourite food is hot dogs,1,,,,,,,,,
He didn't feel like doing too much today,1,,,,,,,,,
They decided not to be lazy,,1,,,,,,,,
He went that way on a whim,,,,,,,,,,
They wanted a sporty challenge,,1,,,,,,,,
Harper loves Hotdogs and wanted them at that moment. Harper is not too fond of Pizza so opted to stick with his favourite food.,1,,,,,,,,,
"Drew doesn't mind trying different foods, however on this occasion he opted for Pizza. As he knows the area well de decided to bypass hotdogs for pizza.",,,1,,,,,,,
Adrian considered hotdogs but when he reached the stand he changed his mind. He knew where the pizza stand was because of where he began his route. So he decided to have pizza instead of hotdogs.,,,,,1,,,,,
Brooklyn opted for hotdogs due to have weak understand of the area. Brooklyn must have thought there may not be a food stand nearby and must have been hungry.,,,1,1,,,,,,
"Taylor must've altered his mind when he approached his favourite food. Knowing the area well, Taylor decided to have Pizza instead as it is around the corner.",1,,1,,,,,,,
Charlie opted for Pizza over Hotdogs. Pizza was more nearby and due to Charlie being lazy it would have been the ideal choice for Charlie.,,1,,1,,,,,,
"Parker wanted his favourite food, even though he is lazy the difference from Pizza to hotdog would'nt have exerted much of his energy.",1,1,,,,,,,,
"Although favourite food is hotdog, Jesse decided to try something else in the area of unknown. Jess was feeling adventurous and thought let us see where this path leads to. Jesse eventually arrived at Pizza stand and decided to have that instead.",1,,1,1,,,,,,
Taylor is very hungry,,,,,1,,,,,
I am not sure with this one at all!,,,,,,,,,1,
Brooklyn wants to take exercise to get his food,,,,,,1,,,,
Charlie likes hotdogs,1,,,,,,,,,
Charlie is lazy,,1,,,,,,,,
Drew prefers hotdogs,1,,,,,,,,,
Harper prefers hotdogs,1,,,,,,,,,
Jesse wants to exercise to enjoy his hotdogs,,,,,,1,,,,
This person went to the pizza stand,,,,,,,,,1,
Jesse does not know the route well of the area that it why  he passed his favourite spot.,1,,1,,,,,,,
Brooklyn is finding his way aound the area,,,1,,,,,,,
Taylor got his favourite spot in the area,1,,1,,,,,,,
Parker probably want to see the environment properly,,,,1,,,,,,
Charlie walks around the area to site see the environment,,,1,1,,,,,,
Drew is trying to know his favourite spot,1,,1,,,,,,,
The easiest way to get his favorite spot,1,,,,,,,,,
"As Brooklyn don't know the area well, they may have wanted to see what options they had, other than pizza, but then after having walked around the houses and seen the other option, decided to go to the pizza truck.",,,1,1,,,,,,
"Although Charlie is lazy, he knows the area well and so it's likely he knew where the hot dog truck was and decided to walk around the houses to the hot dog truck to get his preffered meal.",1,1,1,,,,,,,
"Adrian does not know the area well, and couldn't see either option of truck. He started walking in the direction of the pizza truck and when he reaches it, he stops and doesn't consider exploring further as he is lazy.",,1,1,1,,,,,,
The hot dog truck may have been closed as they are Parker's favourite food and he walked straight passed it.,1,,,1,,,,1,,
"Taylor would know there is a hot dog truck round the on the next corner, and does not seem to be lazy. I think it is likely that Taylor just wanted pizza this day.",1,1,1,1,1,,,,,
"Drew knew their was a hot dog van on the next corner, and whilst they were near the pizza van, decided to walk to the hot dog van as this is what he wanted to eat on this occasion.",,,,1,1,,,,,
Harper started walking in one direction as they don't know the area well and were lucky to find this truck sold hot dogs which are their favourite food.,1,,1,,,,,,,
Jesse is sporty and so walked around the block of houses to see what options they had. They stopped at the hot dog truck as they sell their favourite food.,1,1,,1,,,,,,
Jesse was so hungry that he decided to buy food from the first truck he saw. He doesn't know the area enough to know where the hot dog stand is based.,,,1,1,,,,,,
"Adrian dislikes hotdogs to the point that he would rather avoid them, even when he considers himself lazy.",1,1,,,,,,,,
Parker loves hotdogs and he knows where the hot dog stand is.,,,1,,,,,,,
"Because Harper didn't know where the hot dog stand was, he took the long way around to it. But from their point of view, they continued walking until they found something familiar.",,,1,,,,,,,
I believe Taylor wasn't wearing their glasses when they went out for a jog. That would explain why he didn't stop at the hot dog stand even though his favourite food is hot dogs.,1,,,,,,,,,
Brooklyn simply explored the area and discovered a hot dog stand that captured their eye.,,,,1,,,1,,,
Drew likes walking outside and since he's sporty. He considers it a fun activity. He took a break at the hot dog stand to have a hot dog as a snack before he went on another walk around his neighbourhood.,1,1,,,,,,,,
Charlie lives on pizza and knows that the location is around the corner. So he goes there to get his favourite treat.,1,,1,,,,,,,
They are lazy,,1,,,,,,,,
They dont know the area,,,1,,,,,,,
They wanted to exercise,,,,,,1,,,,
Their favourite food is hot dogs,1,,,,,,,,,
They don't know the area well,,,1,,,,,,,
They wanted to exercise,,,,,,1,,,,
Their favourite food is pizza,1,,,,,,,,,
They are lazy,,1,,,,,,,,
Because Drew knows his way around he is familiar with the food van placement and being a sporty fellow thought he would get some exercise by taking the long way round,,1,1,,,,,,,
"Adrian, in an attempt to find something to eat, got lost because he doean't know the area and had to take the long way round to the pizza cart. Being a lazy fellow, he would have eaten hot dogs but unfortunately the vendor had sold out.",,1,1,,,,,,,
"Harper, not knowing the area well spots a pizza pop-up eatery down the street and asks the vendor where the nearest hot dog stand is situated because they are his favourite food. However he is lazy and doean't want to walk far, but the hunger for hot dogs got the better of him and he takes a walk to the stand",1,1,1,1,,,,,,
Taylor takes his daily stroll to the hot dog stand at the end of his street to consume his favourite food. The vendor has promised to take a hot dog to the pizza seller around the corner and knowing Taylor is a sporty individual offers him a half price hot dog if he delivers another hot dog to the pizza seller.,1,1,1,,,,,,,
"Parker was caught in two minds. Being a lazy fellow his preference is to not expend too much energy and to hit the pizza stall, but his favouirite food are hot dogs and the stand is only a little further than the pizza stall. It was a close call but the hot dogs reign supreme in this case",1,1,,1,,,,,,
Charlie is particularly hungry today and the smell from the pizza cart has him salivating and with the cart only being two houses away he doesn't have to expend too much energy.,,,,1,1,,,,,
"Brooklyn is a physical, sporty individual and he has been to the gym already this morning and is now hungry. He doesn't know the area but can see a hot dog stand down the street.",,1,1,1,,,,,,
"Jesse is new to the area and is keen to find his way around, he can see the hot dog stand at the end of the street, but having eaten hot dogs for severalm days decides to take a jog around to see what else is on offer",,,1,1,,,,,,
Dre knows the area and route to the Pizza building,,,1,,,,,,,
"Charlies know the area to the pizza building but due to his laziness, he is not ready to go",,,1,,,,,,,
Adrian is a lazy person although he doe not know the area to the pizza building,,1,1,,,,,,,

"The favorite food of jesse is hot dog, he is a sporty and lazy person so he his not ready to go for it",1,1,,,,,,,,
Brookly is sporty but does not know the area well so as to go and procure the hot dog,,1,1,,,,,,,
"The favorite food of Taylor is hot dog, he is sporty and conversant with the area but due to his laziness, he is not ready to go",1,1,1,,,,,,,

They can see hot dogs not too far away.,,,,1,,,,,,

He doesn't like pizza and wants to see if there is more choice,1,,,1,,,,,,

It's possible Charlie wanted to look at the hot dog stand and changed his mind.,,,,,,,,1,,
It's possible Jesse didn't like the look of the hot dog stand as it is his favourite food and holds a high standard that wasn't met.,1,,,,,,,,,
They were unaware that a pizza place was closer.,,,,1,,,,,,
Drew knows that the pizza is better than the hot dogs.,,,1,,,,,,,
Harper knows that the hot dogs aren't very good from this stand.,,,1,,,,,,,
Taylor thinks the pizza is too fattening.,,,,,1,,,1,,
Parker wanted to see if there was a queue at the pizza stand but decided to stick with hot dogs,,,,1,1,,,,,
Brooklyn is happy to get some exercise on the way to the hot dog stand and may have taken the same route regardless.,,,,,,1,,,,
Brooklyn saw the Hotdog stall and went there as that is all they knew,,,,1,,,,,,
Jesse was out for a run and came across a Pizza stall,,,,1,,,,,,
Taylor was out for a long run in the area he knew and after a while decided to stop for pizza,,,1,,,,,,,

Jesse doesn't know the area and took the longest route,,,1,,,,,,,
Brooklyn took the longest route because he was sporty,,1,,,,,,,,
Adrian went the shortest way to save energy,,,,1,,,,,,
Taylor preferred pizza that day,1,,,,,,,,,
Harper sort-of knew where the hot dog stand was,,,1,,,,,,,
Charlie preferred hot dogs that day but went the long route for some unknown reason,1,,1,,,,,,,
Parker went to hot dog stand but changed his mind when he got there,,,,,,,,1,,
"Drew knew he could have gotten to the hot dog truck faster through another route, but he was feeling like taking a longer and different path this time",1,,,,,,,,,
"Jesse doesn't know the area, so he assumed that the hot dog truck might be located after the pizza truck that he can see. He chooses this path, knowing that he doesn't mind walking for a bit longer anyway",,,1,1,,,,,,
"Charlie knew that he wanted pizza and didn't particularly want to spend much time getting there, so he took the shortest and most straightforward route to get there",,,,,1,,,,,
"Brooklyn saw the pizza truck but wanted to go around the block and explore the area, as he was feeling in the mood to walk a bit. He ended up going in the opposite direction to the pizza truck and found hot dogs on the way",,,,1,,,1,,,
"Harper must have not been able to see the hotdog truck from where he was, otherwise, he would have gone straight to it",,,,1,,,,,,
"Taylor went out for food, and even though his favourite food is hot dogs, tonight he felt like having pizza instead and taking a long walk at the same time",1,,,,1,,,,,
"Parker wanted hot dogs and didn't particularly want to walk a lot to get there, so he took his usual route to the hot dog truck, which is the fastest one",,,,,1,,,,,
"While Adrian was feeling a bit lazy, he walked past the hot dog truck and didn't feel like eating hot dogs on this occasion, so he kept walking - taking advantage of the opportunity to visit the area - until he found his happiness at the pizza truck",1,1,1,,,,,,,
He didn't feel like having pizza so decided to walk to the hot dog stand instead.,1,,,,,,,,,
Because he is sporty he wanted to take a longer walk.,,1,,,,,,,,
It was the fastest way to the hot dog stand.,,,,1,,,,,,
He wanted to take a longer walk because he is sporty.,,1,,,,,,,,
He likes pizza and this was the shortest way to the pizza stand.,1,,,,,,,,,
He wanted to take a longer walk to the hot dog stand because he is sporty,,1,,,,,,,,
He loves pizza and the pizza stand was the closest to him.,,,,1,,,,,,
He didn't know there was a shorter way to the pizza stand.,,,1,,,,,,,
I think Drew wanted to go the shortest way possible for pizza,,,,1,,,,,,
Visually he could see the hot dog stand so he was guaranteed to be rewarded for his effort,,,,1,,,,,,
When he got to the hot dog stand he didn't really fancy one so he kept walking in the same direction until he found something else,,,,,1,,,,,
He knew where the hot dogs were and went the most direct way to them,,,1,,,,,,,
He can see hot dogs ahead so he took the shortest available route to them,,,,1,,,,,,
Potentially the hot dog stand was closed/didn't have exactly what he wanted so he decided to get pizza instead,,,,1,1,,,1,,
Brooklyn didn't fancy pizza so walked past it and kept going till he found the next stall,,,,,1,,,,,
I have no idea why. Maybe he was on a phone call and needed an extra few minutes on it so had to take the long route to finish up his call,,,,,,,,1,,
"Adrian is lazy so he visited the closest food cart, which was the pizza stand.",,1,,1,,,,,,
Drew went in a straight line to the Hot Dog stand.,,,,,,,,,1,

They went exploring to find somewhere to eat.,,,,,,,1,,,
It is the most direct route to their favourite food vendor.,1,,,,,,,,,

There was something else he needed to do on that route.,,,,,,,,1,,
It is the closest food vendor.,,,,1,,,,,,
There was something else they needed to do on their route.,,,,,,,,1,,
He can see the pizza stand,,,,1,,,,,,

they don't know the quickest way,,,1,,,,,,,
they wanted to eat hot dogs,,,,,1,,,,,
they were going that way anyway,,,,,,,,1,,
they needed to go somewhere else on the way,,,,,,,,1,,
they were going for a walk as they are sporty,,1,,,,,,,,
"Adrian wanted to eat the food they knew the most, and couldn't be bothered to try the other truck. They wondered along aimlessly until they got to the truck on the other side.",,,1,,,,,,,
"Since Charlie is lazy, they just walked to the end of the road to the truck there. They could not see the other one as it was obscured by the houses.",,1,,1,,,,,,
"Despite not being able to see it due to the houses, Jesse is sporty so they jogged until they found the hot dog stand.",,1,,1,,,,,,
"Harper did not know the area well, so they might have been lost and pre-occupied with this so they did not notice the hot dog stand as they walked past it.",,,1,,,,,,,
"Despite Taylor knowing the area well, and knowing the fastest route, they are sporty so they wanted to take the long way round.",,1,1,,,,,,,
"Parker could not be bothered to walk longer to the hot dog stand, despite it being their favourite food. The pizza stand was closer so they went there instead.",1,,,1,,,,,,
Drew wanted to eat the food from the truck that was the furthest distance away as they are sporty.,,1,,,1,,,,,
"Brooklyn probably took a different route to learn the area and did not notice the hot dog stand, but when they went around they saw the pizza truck.",,,1,1,,,,,,
"They walked around the block in a clockwise direction, happy to get the exercise because they decided to have something other than a hot dog today.",,,,,,1,,,,
They decided to walk anti-clockwise around the block to see what they came across and were happy to discover the pizza stand.,,,,1,,,,,,
"They really wanted a hot dog and held out until they could find a hot dog stand, even if it meant walking quite some distance.",,,,,1,,,,,
They knew exactly where to go for a hot dog and chose the shortest route to get there.,,,1,,,,,,,
They set off walking and discovered a hot dog stand en-route and enjoyed a hot dog before walking some more to explore the new area.,,,,1,,,1,,,
"They set off walking to explore the area, discovering a hot dog on the way, but didn't feel like eating a hot dog today and continued on until they discovered the pizza stand.",,,,,1,,1,,,
They knew exactly where to go quickly to get something to eat.,,,1,,,,,,,
They really wanted a hot dog and wanted to make sure they got some good exercise before getting their reward.,,,,,1,,,,,
Drew first wanted a pizza but when arriving there he changed his mind so he carried on to the hotdogs food truck.,,,,,1,,,,,
Parker was hungry so he went straight to the hot dogs food truck which luckily was the closest to him as he is lazy.,,1,,1,,,,,,
Brooklyn wanted to explore the area as he doesn't know it well and when discovering the hot dogs food truck he decided to stop there to eat.,,,,,1,,1,,,
Harper didn't notice the hot dogs food truck or maybe he just wasn't hungry and decided to explore the area but got lost as eventually it took him a long path to get to the hot dogs food truck.,,,,1,,,1,,,
Taylor wanted to exercise and decided to have a pizza for a change.,,,,,1,,,,,
Charlie wanted a pizza.,,,,,1,,,,,
Jesse thought there are no hot dogs in the area as he doesn't know it well so decided to have a pizza when he found a food truck.,,,1,,,,,,,
Adrian badly wanted a pizza so didn't stop at the hot dogs food truck even if it took him longer to get there.,,,,,1,,,,,
To increase thier step count,,,,,,1,,,,
Didnt realise there was a shorter route.,,,1,,,,,,,
Harper took a really short route - cause he was really hungry and wanted to get there with minimal effort,,,,,1,,,,,
Got lost,,,,,,,1,,,
Not being familiar with the area - they didnt know there any easier and short route,,,1,,,,,,,
They were not aware that it was not far away,,,1,,,,,,,
Drew was not in the mood for taking a longer path.,,,,,1,,,,,
Adrian was lucky to source a short route,,,,,,,,,,
THEY ARE STANDING NEXT TO THE HOT DOG STAND,,,,1,,,,,,
drew likes the pizza,1,,,,,,,,,
jesse is stnding next to the hot dog stand,,,,1,,,,,,
harper is stnding at a wrong stand,,,,1,,,,,,
Parker is lazy he ended up at the wrong stand of pizza,,1,,,,,,,,

He likes pizza,1,,,,,,,,,
He was lost,,,,,,,1,,,
He likes hot dogs,1,,,,,,,,,
"He likes pizza, he didn't have time for a long walk",1,,,,,,,,,
He doesn't like pizza,1,,,,,,,,,
Jesse wanted pizza for a change and wanted to get some excersize,,,,,1,,,,,
"He likes hot dogs, the stall was near by",1,,,1,,,,,,
Brooklyn wanted to get some excersize,,,,,,1,,,,
Brooklyn doesn't realise there might be another food truck so goes to the first one spotted.,,,1,,,,,,,
Harper prefers hot dogs to the food on the other truck.,1,,,,,,,,,
Drew wants a long walk first.,,,,,,1,,,,
Jesse fancied a change from their usual favourite food.,1,,,,1,,,,,
This was the closest food that Charlie could see.,,,,1,,,,,,
Taylor wanted to walk further than the hot dog stand.,,,,,1,,,,,
Adrian wanted to get to know the area.,,,1,,,,,,,
Parker really wanted a hot dog so kept walking till he found one.,,,,,1,,,,,
Parker wasn't paying attention and didn't see tje hot dog stand at the corner of the road.,,,,1,,,,,,
Taylor saw the hot dog stand which is his favourite but he went the long way round for some extra exercise because he is sporty.,1,1,,1,,,,,,
Charlie decided to find the other food truck because he doesn't like pizza.,1,,,,,,,,,
Jesse went straight to the hot dog van because he was hungry.,,,,,1,,,,,
Drew went the long way round to get to the pizza truck for extra exercise.,,,,,,1,,,,
Harper went towards the hot dog truck but must have then fancied something different and walked further to find the pizza truck.,,,,,1,,,,,
Adrian went to the pizza truck but didn't see anything he liked so kept going to find another food truck until he came across the hot dog truck.,1,,,1,,,,,,
Brooklyn was hungry so went straight to the pizza truck to get some food.,,,,,1,,,,,
He can see the pizza cart and likes pizza,1,,,1,,,,,,
Charlie is lazy but he prefers pizza and so takes the longer route to get it,1,1,,,,,,,,
"Taylor is more interested in the run, so when he gets to his favourite food he decides to keep running past it and rests instead at the pizza truck",1,,,,,,,,,
Drew knows he could take a right turn and get to the hot dogs quickly but prefers to walk a bit further to get some exercise,1,,1,,,,,,,
Brooklyn is out for a wander in a new area and comes across a hot dog vendor. They decide to treat themselves and is happy to have discovered a local landmark,,,1,,,,,,,
Adrian doesn't like hotdogs but has heard that there may be a pizza truck so kkeps walking because he does like pizza,1,,,,,,,,,
Taylor didn't look to the right and so walked the long route before coming across the hot dog truck,,,,,,,,,,
Parker knows the fastest way to hotdog heaven,,,1,,,,,,,
"As they cant see the stand, I assume they just set off in the opposite direction of the pizza stand, which they can see.",,,,1,,,,,,
"He's lazy so goes for the easy option, ie a pizza",,1,,,,,,,,
"They go for a walk and have no preference for food, so walk past the stand that is only a short distance away.",1,,,,,,,,,
Maybe the hot dogs were not appealing when she got to see them.,,,,1,,,,,,
Maybe he had already exercised and was hungry.,,,,,,1,,,,
"Difficult to say, maybe he had a a guilt complex and felt he needed to exercise a bit.",,,,,,1,,,,
Maybe the hot dog stand had run out of food and they had to go for the next best option,,,,,,,,1,,
He goes to the food stand that he can see.,,,,1,,,,,,
maybe he knows hes lazy and wants to be healthier so he sees the hotdog stand but wants to get some steps in and goees the long way,,1,1,1,,,,,,
he knows where the food stalls are and wants hotdogs so he goes the most efficient way,,,1,,,,,,,
he went to hotdog place but wasnt what he expected so he went back to where he saw a pizza stand or kept walking til he found another food option,,,,1,,,,,,
he knows that the pizza place is around the corner but fancied a walk?,,,1,,,,,,,
fancied pizza instead of hot dogs or fancied a walk,,,,,1,,,,,
maybe he walked and got to pizza place and was unsure whether he would find another food place nearby,,,,1,,,,,,
