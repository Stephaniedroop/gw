Cool study.\n\nThumbs down for using sex neutral pronouns though. Also thumbs down for the ""gender identity"" stuff.\n\nIt's all such nonsense. People can identify however they chose, but it doesn't actually have any impact on their biological sex. \n\nThere's a objective reality that exists outside of the individuals subjective view of the world and trying to live in opposition to that inevitable leads to dire outcomes.\n\nThat is best evidenced by the staggeringly high trans suicide rates. The transexuals eventually come to know the truth they they will never be anything else, but a mutilated version of their birth sex and then they just kill themselves in droves.\n\nSigh, all rainbow flag related stuff really is awful. On that note MC actually saw a rainbow flag today on his way to the supermarket.\n\nWe live in a small town Whitetopia with no rainbow flag population to speak off, but yet the flag still flies high on our civic buildings, from time to time.\n\nThe sole intention of flying that flag is to humiliate the regular townspeople. It works as well as MC struggles to put into words how humiliated he feels when he has to walk under it.\n\nThat flag is surely is not about pride. What pride can there be in living a lifestyle that reduces life expectancy by twenty years and has awful health outcomes in general FFS?\n\nAlso one isn't allowed to criticize it either. One time MC gave it the middle finger and posted the pic on Insta and it was instantly removed for “hate speech”. Sigh, you know who's in power based on which group it's not permissible to criticize.\n\nAlso there's the constant pushing of the rainbow flag and myriad other forms of the GAE's dogmas, from its truly insane state religion, in all forms of entertainment. Christ, it's depressing living in the west.\n\nAt least Russia is winning the war and will the war and NATO's upcoming defeat is going to be a mortal blow for the GAE's ability to push the above society destroying filth. Go Russia.\n\nMC did go off on one there. Usually MC just distracts himself with work and girls etc. Also one can usually avoid the poz by not watching modern shows etc. \n\nSometimes like today though it's just rammed down your throat and it's hard to not go off on one when that happens.",1296462,NA
